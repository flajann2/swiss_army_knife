* Notes
** Design considerations
   + I needed to "hard code" in the URLs, because it does not make
     sense to put them in a resource file, since there is not gaurantee
     alternate endpoints will have the same semantics.
   + Erlang will always be a dependency. No way around it. Cannot be
     so easily embedded into the escript.
